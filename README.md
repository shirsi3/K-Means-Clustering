# K-Means-Clustering
# Lab 7: Clustering Analysis with Synthetic and Real-World Data

This lab explores clustering techniques using both synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting key concepts in data science and machine learning.

## 1. part1_task1.py - Clustering Analysis with Synthetic Data

- **Functionality:** Generates synthetic data using make_blobs, applies K-Means clustering, and visualizes the results.
- **Libraries Used:** numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.cluster

## 2. task2_lab7.py - Clustering Analysis with Real-World Data

- **Functionality:** Reads real-world data, applies K-Means clustering for a range of cluster numbers, and calculates WCSS and silhouette scores for each clustering setup.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.metrics
